=======

enhanced link_to method

	link_to now accepts a :prompt option
	
	:prompt => "why?" attached to link_to will add js functions to your link that will cause a javascript prompt window containing the supplied text 'Why?'
	
	the supplied reason string will be posted to your controller as params[:prompt_reply} for further processing..
	
	simple enough... eh?
